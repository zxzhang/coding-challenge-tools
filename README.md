Coding challenge or existing code?
==================================

The [coding challenge](coding_challenge.md) is optional if you already have
some code that you're proud of and can share with us.

Existing code
-------------

If you have existing code, please follow the following guidelines:

* Include a link to the hosted repository (e.g. Github, Bitbucket...). We cannot
  review archives or single files.
* The repo should include a README that follows the [principles described
  below](#readme) In particular, please make sure to include high-level
  explanation about what the code is doing.
* Ideally, the code you're providing:
  * Has been written by you alone. If not, please tell us which part you wrote
    and are most proud of in the README.
  * Is leveraging web technologies.
  * Is deployed and hosted somewhere.

Readme
------

Regardless of whether it's your own code or our coding challenge, write your
README as if it was for a production service. Include the following items:

* Description of the problem and solution.
* Whether the solution focuses on back-end, front-end or if it's full stack.
* Reasoning behind your technical choices, including architectural. Trade-offs
  you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently
  if you were to spend additional time on the project.
* Link to other code you're particularly proud of.
* Link to your resume or public profile.
* Link to to the hosted application where applicable.

How we review
-------------

Your application will be reviewed by at least three of our engineers. The
aspects of your code we will judge include:

* Clarity: does the README clearly explains the problem and solution?
* Correctness: does the application do what was asked? If there is anything
  missing, does the README explain why it is missing?
* Code quality: is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable?  Are
  there any code smells or other red flags?
* Testing: how thorough are the automated tests? Will they be difficult to
  change if the requirements of the application were to change?
* UX: is the web interface understandable and pleasing to use?
* Technical choices: do choices of libraries, databases, architecture etc. seem
  appropriate for the chosen application?
